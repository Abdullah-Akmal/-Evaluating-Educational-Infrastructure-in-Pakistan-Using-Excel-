# Evaluating-Educational-Infrastructure-in-Pakistan-Using-Excel-

## Problem Statement
Pakistan’s education system faces significant disparities in enrollment, infrastructure, and resource allocation across districts, especially between urban and rural areas. Policymakers often lack access to granular, data-driven insights that highlight these gaps. This project addresses the need for a comprehensive analysis of school-level data from the National School Survey to identify patterns in gender-wise enrollment, infrastructure availability (toilets, electricity, boundary walls, water, security), and operational characteristics such as shifts and medium of instruction. By leveraging Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, analysis, and dashboarding, the project provides actionable insights to support equitable, informed policy decisions aimed at improving access to quality education nationwide.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze gender-wise enrollment and distribution across districts.
- Compare rural vs. urban enrollment trends and averages.
- Identify disparities in school functionality and infrastructure (toilets, security, electricity, boundary walls, water).
- Evaluate medium of instruction across schools.
- Assess school shift operations and gender-based toilet availability.
- Provide actionable insights to support equitable education policies.

## Data Sources

Ministry of Education – National School Survey Dataset

**Key Columns Include:**
- **School Attributes:** District, School Level, School Type, Gender, Medium, Shift
- **Infrastructure:** Boundary Wall, Security, Electricity, Drinking Water, Toilets
- **Enrollment:** Male/Female Headcounts, Urban vs. Rural Classification
- **Operational Status:** Functional vs. Non-Functional Schools

## Key Analyses & Visualizations

### Enrollment Insights
- **Gender-Based Enrollment:** Female schools (52%) slightly outnumber male schools (48%).
- **Urban vs. Rural Enrollment:** Urban areas account for 70.5% enrollment, rural only 29.5%.
- **School Gender-wise Toilets:** Female schools have slightly higher toilet availability.

### School Functionality & Shift
- **Functional Schools:** 99% of all schools are operational.
- **Shift Distribution:** 99% of schools run in the morning shift; only 1% run double shifts.

### Infrastructure Analysis
- **Boundary Walls:** 2.68% of schools lack boundary walls. Bahawalnagar has the highest percentage without.
- **Electricity Access:** 1.56% of schools have no electricity; solar adoption is recommended.
- **Drinking Water:** 0.48% of schools lack water facilities. D.G. Khan is the most affected.
- **Security Levels:** 23.33% have no security; 6.39% have poor security conditions.

### Medium of Instruction
- Urdu medium dominates at 69%.
- 19.5% schools are bilingual (Urdu & English).
- Only 11.5% use English medium.

## Insights & Findings

- Urban schools enjoy significantly better enrollment and infrastructure.
- Most schools are single-shift and functional, but infrastructural deficiencies persist in rural areas.
- Urdu remains the primary language, limiting global readiness.
- Rahim Yar Khan stands out for both best and worst infrastructure contrasts.
- Toilets, walls, electricity, and water show moderate but urgent gaps.

## Recommendations

- Security Measures: Launch mandatory audits and install security systems.
- Boundary Walls: Partner with NGOs to construct walls in vulnerable districts.
- Electricity: Promote solar energy for remote/rural schools.
- Water Access: Provide filtration units or boreholes.
- Medium of Instruction: Train teachers and supply resources for bilingual/English instruction.
- Data Culture: Improve regular data collection and visualization to inform decisions.

## Tools & Technologies

- Microsoft Excel: Core tool for data cleaning, pivot tables, and dashboard visuals.
- Pivot Tables/Charts: For dynamic visual analysis by district, type, and gender.
- Manual Cleaning: Invalid or extreme values converted to NULL or 0.

## Summary

This dashboard equips policymakers with actionable, district-wise insights into the current educational landscape in Pakistan. By focusing on enrollment patterns, infrastructure gaps, and resource distribution, the project helps drive strategic reforms for a more inclusive and well-equipped education system.
